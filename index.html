      It's going to be Slimy-Noodles.com, we just haven't worked out the DNS yet.
    <br />
      Slimy-Noodles.com - For silly things like slimy-noodles.
    <br />
      Slimy-Noodles is going to be something grand... It could be a social network, or it could be some random website, or some random hosting, or something bigger and more useful then slimy-noodles.
